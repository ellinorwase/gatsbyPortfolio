    <p>
      As you've probably already have seen, from the big heading above, my name is Ellinor Vase and I live at Gullmarsplan in Stockholm. I am a 25 year old former kindergarten teacher who chose to change course and study to become a Frontend Developer at Nackademin in Solna. 
      I have now completed my education and I'm therefore looking for a suitable workplace to develop my knowledge.
